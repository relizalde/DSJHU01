As in the previous session:
  These questions are to be submitted with a push to GitHub with the code used, and if applicable, the answer (output). The time of the push will be considered as the submit time, hence the winner will be whoever submitted the correct code/answer faster.


Next are the questions:

1) create a vector with 10000 random normal values with a mean of 15 and a standard deviation of 35 (seed at 1439).

2) create a vector with 10000 random normal values with a mean of 1 and a standard deviation of 0.

3) Get the density of the probability distribution function for both vectors.

4) Plot the result from question 3, with it's corresponding vector.

5) Download the the gas excel file used for quizz 1 of Getting and Cleaning Data (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fdata%2FDATA.gov_NGAP.xlsx) and load the contractos table.
